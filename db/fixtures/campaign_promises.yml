  :description: "Rahm believes that businesses – not government – are the chief engine of job creation and economic growth in Chicago. With a particular focus on small and innovative businesses, Rahm will focus on creating an environment that helps businesses to thrive by ending redundant regulations, simplifying the way small businesses interact with City government, and opening City contracts to the best qualified rather than the best connected. Chicago’s strength and economic vitality are directly tied to the health and livability of its neighborhoods – communities where people can live, work and stay. Creating healthy communities and neighborhood jobs and investments, require careful planning and systematic implementation. Rahm’s plan will make sure planning efforts are coordinated and backed by sufficient resources to deliver results."

Today’s tough economy and highly constrained credit markets have been particularly hard on small neighborhood businesses, making it difficult, if not impossible to invest and grow. Rahm believes in the economic potential of these Chicago businesses and is ready to help invest in their future by expanding and enhancing the Small Business Improvement Fund (SPIF.) SPIF is a program targeted at small businesses located in TIF districts. The program provides grants up to $150,000 to qualifying small businesses to invest in their facilities. Rahm will increase funding for the SPIF program by $15 million annually. He will increase the cap on grant awards to $200,000, expand eligibility for Chicago businesses, and allow for progress payments to grant recipients as projects are implemented and reduce match requirements to address the difficulty that many Chicago businesses are having accessing credit to finance needed improvements."

      :description: "One of the biggest impediments to the growth and success of Chicago’s small and mid-sized manufacturers is the inability to access capital. With the tightening of the financial markets, loans for the purchase of new equipment and materials have become increasingly scarce. Start-up operations with minimal collateral and little credit history have been especially hard hit. While many current government loan programs (including the City’s existing participation loan program) provide borrowers with access to cheap financing, they are largely ineffective in generating new lending in today’s economy because they do nothing to minimize the exposure of risk adverse banks and other lenders. Rahm will create a $15 million Manufacturing Participation Loan Program that will address this problem helping to free up desperately needed financing for the modernization of many Chicago manufacturers. Under Rahm’s program, the City will work with banks and other conventional lending institutions to provide subordinated financial assistance to small and mid-size industrial operations. The City’s participation in any loan won’t exceed 25 percent of total project costs and will be capped at $1,000,000. Manufacturers with 600 or fewer employees will be eligible. Loans could be used for the installation of machinery and equipment, working capital, purchase of land, construction or renovation of buildings. Funds cannot be used for debt refinancing or contingency funding. Participating lending institution shall be responsible for reviewing applications for eligibility and setting terms."

      :description: "Chicago is a leader in freight transport. It stands as a major hub for the country, sustaining 17,000 jobs and nearly $2 billion in annual economic activity, but that leadership and the economic benefits that go with it are in jeopardy. Freight rail traffic is projected to double over the next two decades, far outstripping the capacity of Chicago’s and the region’s infrastructure. The congestion and freight rail bottleneck are not just an inconvenience for the businesses that use rail to move goods to market, they are a tremendous threat to Chicago’s economy that must be addressed or Chicago will lose its position as the national leader.  The Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) is a first-of-its-kind partnership between federal, state and city governments, along with Metra, Amtrak and the nation's freight railroads to invest in capital improvements to increase the efficiency of the region's rail infrastructure. Rahm will provide the leadership to move CREATE from an innovative strategy to a fully implemented reality. He will lobby federal and state governments to fully-fund the initiative and push expedite its implementation.  Rahm also knows that we need to do more than just implement CREATE, we need to seize the economic opportunities that come from it and prepare for what happens after it. Rahm will make sure Chicago is ready – he will direct his administration to assemble large tracts of developable land, coordinate economic development planning and incentives, and implement complementary infrastructure investments to maximize job creation and retention. At the same time, he will work with other public and private sector leaders to establish a framework for long term investment and improvement in freight infrastructure and better coordination with passenger rail service as the demand for that service grows."

The Illinois International Port District is a major landowner and agency in Lake Calumet. With a board jointly appointed by the Mayor and the Governor, the District manages both port operations and the industrial land and leases for private firms located on District property. The Port District has to be reformed and modernized to support industrial and environmental restoration of the Southeast Side. Rahm will work with the Governor to make modernization of the Port District an economic development priority. He will commission a complete management audit of its functions and performance and establish clear qualifications for board and staff appointments and a detailed roadmap for making the Port and effective partner in the redevelopment of this critical region."

      :description: "Industrial revenue bonds (IRBs) are tax-exempt financing vehicles typically issued by state or local governments to provide qualified manufacturing companies with an inexpensive form of debt. Under the recent American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the applicability of IRB’s was greatly expanded to include activities beyond traditional manufacturing such as certain types of research and development and elements of warehousing and distribution. The new IRBs could be an important tool for economic revitalization, but they continue to be an unusable tool for many Chicago manufacturers looking to finance expansion due to unrealistic ceilings on total project costs. Rahm will lobby the federal government to reform the IRB law to promote urban redevelopment, increasing IRB caps on capital costs and streamlining requirements."

Community planning modeled after LISC’s successful New Communities program, needs to be implemented in a comprehensive way by the City. But plans only improve communities when they are implemented, and Rahm will make sure plans don’t just sit on the shelf.

Currently, the City has too many plans and not enough coordination and implementation. The City’s Capital Improvement Program, individual TIF Redevelopment plans, and the Community Development Block Grant Action Plan, allocate well over $2 billion annually, but don’t effectively coordinate that spending or define clear development and return on investment objectives for the dollars spent. As a result, opportunities are missed and accountability lost. As Mayor, Rahm will require that any plan must be accompanied by detailed multi-year investment strategy to get it implemented. He will direct Housing & Economic Development, Law and Budget to develop those strategies, and fully incorporate them into the City codes and regulations, the Capital Improvement Program, individual and city-wide TIF plans and the CDBG Action Plan."

      :description: "Real estate values have lost 30 – 40% during the recession – much more in low to moderate income communities. Chicago’s most vulnerable communities are also plagued by high rates of foreclosure, unemployment, business vacancies and abandonment. The City estimates that there are approximately 19,000 vacant buildings and 10,000 to 15,000 vacant lots in Chicago. In communities hardest hit by the recession, there are severe barriers to private investment, and City leadership and action are essential. Rahm will make sure Chicago utilizes every tool possible – like land donations, demolition liens, and non-cash bids on delinquent taxes – to make sure investments are targeted and comprehensive, to give communities the greatest chance to redevelop and succeed. Rahm’s strategy will develop and implement plans for re-use of all buildings and vacant lots in the targeted areas from rehab and new construction, to adjacent neighbor land donations, parking improvements, community gardens and urban agriculture. For example, Rahm’s plan to address food deserts will employ urban agriculture as an effective transitional use in communities hard hit by disinvestment. Rahm will increase support for urban agriculture by recognizing the important role that it can play in overall community development, systematically evaluating the potential of vacant lots and making more effective use of funds like the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program and Community Development Block Grants to bring fresh produce, jobs and redevelopment to hard hit neighborhoods."

      :description: "Modern and efficient infrastructure and ready access to available land are essential to job creation and economic development, and produce the biggest economic impact when they are planned and implemented in a coordinated manner. Rahm will establish clear polices that set economic development metrics for infrastructure investments and land acquisition decisions, and he will report publicly how the City is performing. Rahm’s plan for the Red Line expansion demonstrates the benefits of this strategic approach. He will start by issuing an executive order that establishes clear and consistent principles for transit oriented development (TOD) – expedited permitting, set-aside of city-owned property to expand car sharing and bike parking, assistance with land assembly, expanded use of tax credits and loan guarantees, and identification of instances where the City will jointly invest with CTA to improve the transit system. The order will recognize the clear link between housing and transportation costs in keeping neighborhoods affordable, and will evaluate TOD improvements on their ability to reduce the combined cost of housing and transportation for Chicago residents. This policy will help to focus all investment – including in Chicago’s TIF districts – around developments that integrate station upgrades with mixed-use developments. The Red Line investments will then be linked to other strategies like his plan to bring healthy food to underserved areas, and Rahm will coordinate infrastructure investments to spur development of new stores, making sites more attractive to developers and more convenient for customers. Grocery stores will be a critical part of his transit oriented development policy and a priority for new station developments as part of the construction of the Red Line expansion to 130th Street."

    - :name: "Cut taxes that impede business growth:"
      :description: "Too many parts of the Chicago tax code are impediments to growth. The City boasts the highest sales tax of any big city in the country, burdening consumers and making it harder for Chicago retailers to compete. In fact, Chicago lags behind the State and nation in retail jobs and losing sales and jobs to on-line transactions and businesses outside of Chicago. Rahm’s plan would cut Chicago’s portion of the sales tax by 20 percent – from 1.25% to 1% – while working with state legislators to expand the tax base by closing the loopholes that allow luxury services to go untaxed. Taken together with county action to return its sales tax rate to 2008 levels, these changes will reduce the sales tax in Chicago to 9% from the current 9.75% by 2013. Smaller businesses are also burdened by a regressive percent-based natural gas tax. When gas prices skyrocket, the City reaps a tax windfall at the expense of Chicago businesses and homeowners. Rahm will convert the utility tax to a fixed per-unit fee, giving a break to taxpayers and reducing financial barriers to improving building energy efficiency. Rahm’s plan to triple energy efficiency upgrades will then be available so those businesses can get the financial support they need to invest in efficiency upgrades that cut energy costs and increase competitiveness.For medium-sized businesses, the so-called “head tax” penalizes job creation in Chicago by adding a $1 tax for every new employee. Chicago’s economic well-being depends on its ability to attract, create and retain good paying jobs in critical sectors like manufacturing so that all Chicagoans have access to employment opportunities. Taxing manufacturers and other employers for the jobs they create is bad, short-sighted policy and Rahm will put a stop to it. He has proposed a complete phase-out of the tax over the next four years, with a full offset of the revenue lost by reducing duplicative regulatory requirements and bureaucracy that further burden investment and job creation."

The requirements can discourage innovation and job creation and can be especially daunting for small businesses. The system is too complex and regulation, permitting and enforcement are too splintered. Rahm will make it easier to follow the law, streamlining the bureaucracy and professionalizing regulatory programs. He will issue an executive order that mandates a coordinated inspection process and requires department heads to work together to simplify and standardize licensing and permit processes. The complete review of regulatory programs will cover everything from simplifying permit forms to upgrading professional training and certification requirements for city inspectors. The use of nationally recognized codes and standards will be increased to modernize and simplify compliance. He will reduce duplicative inspections that create confusion and waste taxpayer resources and increase opportunities for self certification of compliance for routine matters by licensed professionals."

But the City makes it too difficult for hard-working businesspeople to work with the City and follow the law. Chicago business is burdened by excessive paperwork and out of date City bureaucratic processes. Rahm will eliminate burdensome reporting requirements and establish easy, paperless reporting for all business permit, regulatory and procurement transactions within 24 months of taking office. All businesses will able to file for permits, certify performance, file bids and proposals for city work and check the status of City action electronically. Businesses will only have to use paper reports if they choose to do so. He will further enhance electronic services with and easy, smart phone application that will include filing compliance information regarding City inspections. Businesses will be able to use their smart phones to file their applications and submit information like photos of compliance as part of City inspections.

But the City’s procurement process is antiquated, slow, and not transparent. Rahm will work to professionalize procurement by increasing coordination of procurement efforts and dramatically expanding joint purchasing with the City’s sister agencies. Streamlining these disparate processes will result in common forms, standards, and reporting requirements so that companies – and small businesses in particular – face lower entry barriers to city contracts. As part of Rahm’s overhaul, there will be a new ChicagoFirst policy to mandate that procurements decisions will favor Chicago companies when all other factors are equal.

Rahm's education agenda is guided by a single mission: to ensure that every child in Chicago has access to a world-class learning experience. To achieve this, he has put forward specific proposals around three themes – empowering principals with greater autonomy and holding them accountable for their school’s performance; giving teachers the resources they need to succeed and rewarding them for excellence; and providing parents with more information about their child’s education so that they can be more actively involved.

The annual cost of the program – $50 million – would be funded initially through private investment. Over time, the Innovation Fund will be underwritten by the city from savings found in the CPS budget.

As traditional public school leaders receive greater autonomy, they should also be expected to meet performance benchmarks and innovate in their schools. A five-year contract – signed between the principal and CPS – will set clear expectations and accountability.  Any leadership team that fails to live up to the terms of the performance contract can lose control of the school. The school could then be closed, turned over to new management, or have its leadership team and staff replaced.  Performance contracts will cover more than growth in standardized test scores.

Rahm would like to double the number of academies and allow the graduates to teach in any Chicago public school – traditional, turnaround, magnet or charter. The current teacher-training program produces 50-70 new teachers each year, at a cost to CPS of $3.5 million.  The program could be scaled up over two years to produce 150 new teachers a year, at a cost to CPS of about $10 million.

      :description: "Chicago has one of the shortest school days and shortest school years in the country. Our eighth grade students are more than a full grade level behind their Boston peers in math and nearly a grade behind their Boston peers in reading. Part of the reason isn't surprising Chicago students are in the classroom one hour less than their Boston counterparts. Until learning time is extended, particularly for students that need it most, achievement won't dramatically improve.Chicago's teachers are committed to improving student outcomes and often are employed by CPS in various after school programs throughout the school year. However, the current contract restricts learning time and puts our children and our city at a competitive disadvantage. Rahm will work with the teachers' union to lengthen the learning day and school year because it's the right investment in our children and our city's global standing. Increased learning time will include academic, arts and sports programs beyond the traditional school day – building on the success of the community school model in place in some Chicago schools – and forging new, creative partnerships with community and civic organizations that extend the school day, week and year. Given the cost-effectiveness of technology, we must also include on-line learning during after school programs. Rahm will also invest a portion of the Chicago Innovation Fund in schools with the best, most cost-effective ideas for lengthening the school day, week and year."

      :description: "Rahm has proposed a Chicago Curriculum Project to ensure our children are the most competitive and college-ready in the nation. Specifically, this public-private initiative will make Chicago the first city to meet the new federal college- and career-ready curriculum standards. These standards have been developed by a bipartisan group of state governors and chief state school officers to provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn while giving flexibility to teachers to determine how best to help students meet them. Nearly 40 states – including Illinois – have adopted the standards, but no municipality has yet to integrate the standards into local curriculum. The Project will work with teachers, administrators and parents to propose and assess changes to the city's curriculum to meet these new standards, will pilot in several public and alternative schools, and will build capacity through teacher training."

      :description: "While supporting principals, teachers and parents will improve school performance throughout the city, Chicago needs to invest dedicated effort, ingenuity and resources into the city’s high schools.  While improving slightly over the last decade, Chicago’s drop out rates remain stubbornly high and those who go on to college often don't have the high school education needed to succeed. Rahm will focus first on turning around Chicago’s dropout factories (and their feeder schools), which account for 50% of Chicago school dropouts.  This will include creating new school options for families – replicating successful neighborhood high schools, magnet schools, developing new schools, leveraging successful turnaround efforts and building a deeper network of alternative schools for students who do not succeed in the mainstream. Tackling Chicago’s toughest schools will require more than creating new school options. It will depend on targeted investments in increased social supports for children with the greatest barriers to academic learning – social workers, college counselors, and staff charged with intervening and supporting students before they drop out. And it will depend on the city stepping up. Rahm will incent community based organizations, citywide non-profits, universities, commercial companies and other civic institutions to bring their people and programs to bear to support particular struggling schools by providing mentors, tutors, job training, access to college courses, and in classroom support to schools that need it most."

First, the program does not establish the unit cost of services or benchmark services against other comparable public and private sector leaders. Second, the program is not subject to public review and regular reporting to the City Council. Rahm will change that. Rahm will tie performance measures to a limited number of clearly defined goals for the City. Managers will be held accountable for meeting or beating goals and employee training and evaluation will be driven by continuous improvement of both service quality and efficiency. To support continuous improvement, critical services will be prioritized and benchmarked against other comparable cities and public and private sector top performers for both the quality and cost of service. There will be measurable cost reduction and service improvement targets for each performance measure, they will be reported to the public and City Council, and quarterly progress reports will be issued. The reporting will include an easy to access dashboard and exception report that flags any measure that doesn’t meet the target or shows a negative performance trend."

Rahm will reorganize government to improve accountability and management effectiveness and reduce costs by $110 million. This is not about simply consolidating department or cutting positions – it’s about rethinking the way that City government is structured and operates. The greatest cost savings come from reducing layers of management bureaucracy and consolidating redundant tasks, producing $80 million from increased efficiency and productivity. Rahm will also look for opportunities to merge departmental functions and establish clear costs for internal services resulting in $30 million in savings. For example, General Services and Fleet Management could be merged, and the Department of Innovation and Technology could fold into the Budget Office. The consolidation and mergers will save money through strategies that include eliminating unnecessary layers of management and improving performance and accountability for all city services – from buying energy to programming city buildings and innovation in city fleet and transportation. Technology expenditures will focus on improving services and saving money instead of expensive systems and inflated salaries. The cost of internal services like fleet and building maintenance, billing and payroll processing will be benchmarked and cost reduction targets will be set and met."

      :description: "One city service ripe for reform is Chicago’s trash collection system. Rahm’s plan is built on the belief that Chicago’s workers can innovate and make services more efficient if given set targets and the opportunity to compete. The plan is estimated to save $40 million to $65 million a year while improving services. As a first step, Rahm will report the cost to pick up a ton of garbage and benchmark performance to those numbers. Then, Streets and Sanitation will be tasked with finding efficiencies that reduce costs to the agreed benchmarks. Costs will have to be reduced without negatively impacting service, and worker safety will have to improve. If benchmarks aren’t met, Rahm will introduce managed competition to improve performance and reduce costs. In nearly every bureaucracy that has opened itself to managed competition, public employees have won the majority of contracts. Indianapolis reduced its vehicle maintenance costs by 21%, and reduced labor grievances and workers’ compensation claims. Federal government workers won 83% of public/private competitions from 2003 to 2007, finding new ways to lower costs and generating $7.2 billion in savings because of competition. In Charlotte, public employees won over 70% of bids by driving down costs and streamlining operations in the face of competition."

Fixing it will create opportunities for Chicago businesses, encourage competition and save money. Within the first 60 days of taking office, Rahm’s administration will review current contracts to prioritize savings opportunities. Procurement professionals will be brought in to evaluate the need for each contract and assess if the city has gotten a fair deal. Contracts will be renegotiated and, when appropriate, cancelled. Making sure that the city only buys what it needs and gets fair and competitive prices when it does make a purchase is estimated to save Chicago more than $20 million. The competitive procurement process will be made more transparent both for taxpayers and for firms interested in doing business with the City of Chicago. The city’s contractor database will be improved to include a dashboard summary report that lists the top vendors receiving city business. The report will be issued for individual departments and on a city wide basis. Also, the report will list all related companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures etc. in listing the total work for the companies to ensure that the public is able to get a complete picture of the extent of city business that any company or its affiliates receives. The search function of the contractor database will be improved to ensure that it also captures and reports this important cumulative information. Additionally, firms that compete for city work won’t be kept in the dark about the city’s requirements and the basis of contracting decisions. As is standard best practice in procurement departments around the country, the Procurement Department will routinely meet with unsuccessful responsible proposers to provide a debriefing on the proposal review process so that those firms can sharpen their approaches for future opportunities. The best deals go to customers that are fair and pay on time. Many government’s try to hide their budget problems, by delaying payments trying to balance public budgets on the backs of the businesses and agencies that work with them. Like homes and businesses around the city, If Chicago doesn’t have the money it shouldn’t sign the contract. Rahm will make sure that businesses and agencies that have a contract with the city are paid promptly, and the time it takes to pay city obligations will be reported to the public and City Council."

Rahm will improve coordination of grant dollars and free up over $30 million for improved services.

City per capita debt has risen 121.9% over the last 10 years, and payments on that debt now take up, approximately, 21% of the City’s annual budget, above the level that rating agencies and outside experts consider advisable. The City has to get more out of the limited dollars available by improving coordination and performance of capital improvement projects.When departments plan projects in isolation they miss opportunities to reduce cost, attract outside resources and reduce the disruption to Chicago residents and businesses that often come with extended construction projects. Rahm, will improve efficiency by establishing a centralized capital improvement program management office (PMO) to plan, coordinate and oversee all City infrastructure projects. He will invite sister agencies like the CTA to participate in the PMO. The PMO will be staffed by senior infrastructure managers from individual departments, Budget and Mayors Offices. Its first task will be to review the existing capital improvement plan to prioritize projects and identify cost savings from better scheduling and project coordination.

There is too much at stake to take the risk that property tax dollars aren’t being spent wisely or responsibly. Rahm’s TIF reform proposal will increase performance and bring greater transparency, accountability and flexibility to the program. First, it shines a light on the TIF decision-making process by putting all financial and spending information online in an easy-to-use format and ensures that TIF spending is fully integrated into the formal city budgeting process. Second, Rahm has proposed a time-limited panel of economic development and financial experts to establish return-on-investment goals for each TIF to accelerate job creation, and close TIFs that have achieved growth targets or are ineffective and can’t be fixed.

Violence also drives both businesses and residents out of the city further eroding the city’s tax base. Rahm’s aggressive anti-crime agenda takes on the most important drivers of crime in Chicago and re-directs resources to the most effective strategies for fighting crime. Central to this strategy is the cop on the street who is the backbone of Chicago’s police force. Morale is suffering and the next Mayor’s first responsibility is restoring trust in police leadership. He has a record of standing with officers – he put 100,000 cops on the street while serving President Clinton, and has fought for the past decade to give them the resources they need to fight gangs, drugs and guns. He will bring that same passion to the streets of Chicago with a plan that puts more cops on the street, provides comprehensive afterschool programming for Chicago’s children so that they spend more time in the classroom than on the street corner, decentralizes the police command structure, and pushes for stronger gun control laws on the federal, state and local level.

This strategy would add 250 police officers to specialized units that are strategically deployed to target crime in and around TIFs that are impacted by high crime rates. Driving down violent crime will help stabilize communities, raise property values and make neighborhoods attractive for investment and job creation – the exact purpose of the TIF program. Deployment of police officers would depend on factors such as the type and level of violent crime and the geographic footprint of the TIF area (i.e. is it in one police district or does it overlap into others).

Rahm would like to overhaul and strengthen the Chicago Police Cadet program and use the new group of cadets to perform administrative responsibilities so that cops can return to the street. The cadet program enables students between the ages of 17 and 21 to learn police procedures while attending college. In addition to receiving exposure to the police profession, cadets perform a variety of clerical duties. Under Rahm’s overhaul, cadets would be given meaningful responsibilities and later be eligible to be hired by CPD as police officers when they finish the program. Graduating cadets would be given hiring preference behind military personnel – providing a real incentive for the best and the brightest to join the program. The new program would also ensure that cadets provide consistent support to specific departments during their tenure, providing a level of consistency for the commanders that oversee them. There are three main opportunities to replace administrative police work with cadets: (1)  Desks at each district are currently staffed by sworn officers. Cadets are able to complete many of those tasks and can replace cops so that they can return to the beat, 2.  Most districts also have additional officers working clerical roles in the Commander's Office and in other support functions. Many of those officers can return to the street and be replaced with a cadet in the office., 3.

Reducing various layers of bureaucracy can save millions of dollars that will be reinvested in putting dozens of new cops on the street. Rahm will give the new Superintendent a mandate to make these efficiency changes and further streamline operations. For example, there continues to be a Commander in charge of the Inspections Division despite a significantly-dwindling number of personnel there.

While the details will be worked out with non-profit partners, teachers and CPS officials, Rahm will require that the program meet several basic requirements: (1)  The program must run five days a week for the entirety of the school year. It must run at least two-and-a-half hours per day. (2) The program must offer opportunities in three areas – academics, arts and athletics. The mix will allow all students to extend their academic learning day by an hour each day, and add on an elective in sports or cultural arts for an additional hour. (3)  The program will be staffed through a mix of teachers and community-based non-profit staff, and would be coordinated by the new Director of Family and Community Engagement that Rahm proposed as part of his education plan. The Director will have access to a menu of programs and professionals that would be vetted by the central office. Each school would have the flexibility to individualize its offerings based on local needs. (4) The program should reach the most at-risk youth and be used to incentivize parental involvement. Those parents who stick by their commitment in the parent-teacher contract will get priority spots for their children in after-school programs (5)  Almost all CPS children are eligible for a “third meal option” – a snack or a hot meal after school – that they would receive during the after-school hours. The cost for this meal is covered by the federal government. The cost of the program is estimated at $95 million per year.

Much of the federal funding is restricted to specific types of programming, so the remaining $30 million would be raised from two sources – $5 million can be raised through school partnerships with local businesses and non-profit organizations that want to target specific schools and communities with innovative after-school programming, and $25 million from new advertising revenues that will be earmarked for enhanced educational opportunities. This would include new ads on the City’s vehicle stickers, on garbage trucks, and at other public venues, like farmers’ markets. The specific approaches will be finalized as part of Rahm’s broader plan to bring in outside experts to identify and prioritize potential assets where advertising would be appropriate. The team will provide both a revenue estimate and a recommended process for implementing the plan. On all of the assets, Rahm will ensure there are adequate disclaimers and limitations on the extent to which advertising will be allowed."

But there are many important cross-system opportunities, such as getting a young person to graduate from high school because of its significant crime reduction impact. And many youth most at risk for high school dropout have already come to the attention of the juvenile and criminal justice systems as well as other public agencies. As mayor, Rahm will create a central focus across city departments and working collaboratively with county, state and federal agencies, to ensure that cross system coordination and collaboration are the rule rather than the exception. As a start, Rahm will create a commission across city agencies to share information every time a school age youth is shot in the city. The School Age-Youth Shooting Review Commission would systematically review all the data available on every Chicago youth that is shot to help identify patterns and gaps in key services, and to develop effective strategies to prevent gun violence among school age youth. The Milwaukee Homicide Review Commission provides a model for doing this."

Reducing Chicago’s energy demand also keeps money in people’s pockets and in the region’s economy. Nearly 7,000 Chicago buildings underwent significant retrofits in 2009. Rahm wants to triple that number by creating a $10 million fund that allows current programs to be significantly scaled and expanded. The city’s investment is projected to leverage an additional $100 million in outside resources from ComEd, People’s Gas, and various governmental and lending institutions. The plan is estimated to create more than 400 good-paying jobs and reduce harmful carbon emissions by more than 5,000 tons – the equivalent of cutting our gas consumption by 618,000 gallons annually. Rahm’s plan begins by designating a dozen Energy Efficiency Target Zones in areas that are shown to be least energy efficient, and selects an anchor organization in each area to act as a one-stop-shop to significantly increase efficiency projects. He then creates a $10 million fund to support efforts in each zone so that local building owners can leverage an additional $100 million in private and public funds. Finally, the plan sets a firm deadline to complete an online one-stop-shop so that every Chicagoan can easily navigate the funding options to make efficiency improvements in their own homes and businesses."

Rahm’s first transit priority will be a complete overhaul of the Red Line: rebuilding deteriorating tracks south to 95th Street, extending the line south to 130th and renovating and modernizing Red Line stations and track north of Belmont. This major infrastructure investment will require active and sustained lobbying on the federal and state level for funding, as well as creative use of public-private partnerships around each new station. Rahm will make it a major priority of his administration – just as he did for the Brown line rehab – knowing that this project will not just improve Chicago's transit system, but will also create 4000 good-paying construction jobs, reduce congestion, jumpstart economic development and improve Chicago’s competitiveness. He is committed to securing all necessary federal sign-offs to have all three phases of the project underway in the first year of his administration. Once federal approvals are in place, he will expedite the construction to complete the south side track improvements and station expansions within four years, and complete all north side improvements within seven years.The south section track repair will improve a ten-mile stretch of track from 18th to 95th Street and eliminate slow zones. As existing track is repaired, the Red Line extension will add four new station south of 95th at 103rd, 111th, 115th and 130th Streets, extending the line an additional 5.5 miles. The extension will provide substantial relief at 95th – the CTA’s busiest station outside of downtown – and significantly improve bus and rail connections and overall service in an area that is heavily dependent upon affordable transit as an essential service. Together, the southern improvements and extensions accomplish several important economic development objectives including improving commute times for far south residents to downtown, establishing convenient bus links to growing far south employment centers and creating regional industrial and commercial development opportunities in and near the new stations. The Red and Purple Line modernization north of Belmont will repair and improve the 100 year-old transit corridor to eliminate slow zones, improve accessibility for people with disabilities, speed travel times and expand transit options. Improvement of the line is essential to the livability and affordability of the densely populated neighborhoods it serves, and provides a tremendous opportunity to fully realize the economic and environmental benefits of transit oriented development. The project will require resources from governments at all levels to rebuild and extend the critical infrastructure matched by private investments to create jobs and development in and near transit stations. The project can be expedited, dollars can be leveraged and costs reduced by a strategy that forms a strong partnership between CTA and the City to coordinate planning and investment, maximize state and federal support and attract private investments and job creation.

The Board should be focused on providing legal opinions and guidance that holds all government officials – including City Council members – to the highest standards, not as a venue to find wiggle room in ordinances.  Ethics investigations should be handled by an empowered IGs Office. Rahm will introduce in his first six months a major overhaul of the ethics ordinance. It is an outdated document that is vague and full of loopholes that allow for liberal interpretations to skirt laws. The Board’s records and information should also be fully transparent to the Inspector General so that the IG’s office is able to use the information to root out waste and corruption."

The tragic deaths of so many middle and high school Chicago students cry out for urgent steps to be taken to halt the senseless violence and gang warfare. Establishing a task force with CPS and Chicago law enforcement personnel will be a priority to help solve this problem faced by Chicago school children.  The recent string of LGBT youth suicides across the country has underscored that bullying is a critical issue plaguing schools.  For many in the LGBT community, this problem is all too familiar – more than 85 percent of gay and lesbian youth report being harassed in school and a third report having skipped school out of fear. Our city cannot be whole until every child feels secure and welcome in our schools. While we have made progress toward equality and acceptance in Chicago, we need to end bullying by changing the culture in our schools to prevent it from happening in the first place. Anytime bullying is accepted or ignored, a student pays the price. Rahm will make 100% enforcement of anti-bullying policies an absolute mandate and task the incoming CPS leader to test new strategies to end bullying. Teachers and administrators, hall monitors and lunch room aides all must set the tone and engage directly whenever bullying takes place. Encouraging parental involvement in our students education increases the likelihood that students will succeed in school – and it can also have an impact on a students conduct in the classroom. Rather than avoiding the issue, schools should embrace LGBT youth and make clear that it is okay to be a gay or lesbian student in Chicago and Chicago Public Schools. Gay-straight alliances and other programs that provide support for LGBT youth can help to ensure that our schools are welcoming all students.

It then creates a time-limited panel of economic development and financial experts to establish best practices and return-on-investment goals for each TIF to accelerate job creation, and will shutter TIFs that have met their goals or are ineffective. Finally, it gives communities the flexibility they need to implement a comprehensive economic development plan in their TIF area.

Rahm proposes a 3 year strategy to drive down the violent crime rate in these areas by using excess TIF funds that are intended to promote economic development in each location. This strategy would add 250 police officers to new squads that target crime in and around TIFs that are impacted by high crime rates. Driving down violent crime will help stabilize communities, raise property values and make neighborhoods attractive for investment and job creation – the exact purpose of the TIF program. Deployment of police officers would depend on factors such as the type and level of violent crime and the geographic footprint of the TIF area (i.e. is it in one police district or does it overlap into others).  The cost of this initiative – $25 million – comes from the approximately $900 million in available TIF funds."

The lack of a store also cripples a neighborhood’s ability to attract economic investment that will lead to job growth, and creates areas that show significantly higher rates of health problems. A recent study found that, among those living in neighborhoods with the worst access to fresh food, 1 out of every 100 residents die from cardiovascular issues – nearly double the rate found in areas that have access to grocery stores.
